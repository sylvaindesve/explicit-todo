## Ubiquitous language

The ubiquitous language for this project is:

> A **Todo list** has a **Name** and several **Items**. A **Todo list** can be
> created and its name can be changed. **Items** have a **Description** and a
> **Status** which can be **Done** or **To do**. An item description can be
> changed and it can be marked as done.
